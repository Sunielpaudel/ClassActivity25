# Customer Management System

## Overview

This project implements a simple Customer Management System in C++. It allows users to create customer records, which include personal details and an associated address. The program uses structures to represent the customer and their address, demonstrating the concept of nested structures in C++.

## Objectives

- *Learn C++ Structures*: Understand how to define and use structures in C++.
- *Nested Structures*: Implement and utilize nested structures to represent complex data models.
- *User Input*: Collect user input and store it in structured data.
- *Data Display*: Display customer details and their address in a formatted manner.

## Features

- *Customer Structure*: Represents customer details such as ID, name, and email.
- *Address Structure*: Nested within the customer structure to represent street, city, and ZIP code.
- *Data Entry*: Prompts the user to input customer details and address information.
- *Data Output*: Displays all entered customer information in a clear format.

## File Structure

- Customer.hpp: Header file containing declarations of the Customer and nested Address structures.
- Customer.cpp: Source file containing the definitions of the methods for displaying customer and address details.
- main.cpp: The main program that collects user input and invokes methods to display customer information.
